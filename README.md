# Focus-Mode
Focus Mode is a software that allows you to keep unwanted or distracting apps/websites in the taskbar, or even close them - it's supposed to be a simple replica of the Focus Mode for Android. You can customize it using the Settings.ini file, make sure to restart the app after!

Download the first (functioning) version here: https://github.com/mangoepic/Focus-Mode/releases

If you have any issues with the software feel free to open an Issue in the issues panel.
